    <!-- Testimonials
  ====================================== -->
    <h4>Learn to code</h4>
    <p>"At this time last year, I was stuck in a dead end job, was questioning my career, and felt like I wasn't living up to my potential. This year, I have a job at a place that is genuinely excited to help me learn and grow. I'm really passionate about development and couldn't be more excited to keep learning in this field."</p>
    <p>- Anna, former student</p>

    <h4>Gain hands-on experience</h4>
    <p>"The internship I did with Epicodus was an awesome experience and invaluable in my job search. After completing Epicodus, I sent out quite a few resumes, and ultimately had the choice between two very interested companies. I've worked just over a month now at my new job and couldn't be happier."</p>
    <p>- Diego, former student</p>

    <h4>Find a new direction</h4>
    <p>"Going through this program and learning a viable skill has turned my life completely around. You helped me kindle a passion and desire for programming and I actually wake up with a smile knowing I have a job I enjoy. I feel this is something I can really excel at."</p>
    <p>- David, former student</p>
